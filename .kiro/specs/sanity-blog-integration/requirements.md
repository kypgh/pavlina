# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Sanity CMS with the existing Next.js blog page to enable content management for blog posts. The integration will replace the current hardcoded blog posts with dynamic content from Sanity, including a content management studio embedded within the project. Blog posts will have essential fields (title, description, body, featured image, slug) and support rich text editing with inline images.
